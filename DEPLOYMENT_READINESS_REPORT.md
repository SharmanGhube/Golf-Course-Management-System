## ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Deployment)

### 🔐 **1. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES - CRITICAL**

#### **A. Hardcoded Secrets in .env**
```env
# INSECURE - MUST CHANGE
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
DB_PASSWORD=golf_password
```
**Impact:** High - Anyone with code access can forge JWTs  
**Fix Required:** Generate cryptographically secure secrets

#### **B. Default/Weak Database Credentials**
```yaml
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword  # ❌ INSECURE
MYSQL_PASSWORD: golf_password       # ❌ WEAK
```
**Impact:** Critical - Database vulnerable to brute force  
**Fix Required:** Use strong passwords (20+ chars, mixed case, symbols)

#### **C. CORS Wildcard Configuration**
```go
c.Writer.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
```
**Impact:** High - Allows requests from any domain  
**Fix Required:** Restrict to specific frontend domain

#### **D. Password Hashing Review Needed**
- ✅ Uses bcrypt (good)
- ⚠️ Need to verify cost factor is adequate (should be ≥12)

#### **E. Docker Image Vulnerabilities**
- ❌ Backend image: 1 critical + 6 high vulnerabilities
- ❌ Frontend image: 2 high vulnerabilities
**Fix Required:** Update base images to latest versions

#### **F. No Rate Limiting**
- ❌ Missing API rate limiting
- ❌ Vulnerable to brute force attacks on login
**Fix Required:** Implement rate limiting middleware

#### **G. SQL Injection Prevention**
- ✅ Using GORM ORM (prevents most SQL injection)
- ⚠️ Need to verify all raw queries are parameterized

### 🔒 **2. MISSING SECURITY FEATURES**

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| HTTPS/TLS | ❌ Not configured | CRITICAL |
| API Rate Limiting | ❌ Missing | HIGH |
| Request Size Limits | ❌ Missing | HIGH |
| Input Validation | ⚠️ Partial | HIGH |
| CSRF Protection | ❌ Missing | MEDIUM |
| Security Headers | ❌ Missing | HIGH |
| API Key Rotation | ❌ Missing | MEDIUM |
| Audit Logging | ❌ Missing | HIGH |

### 🧪 **3. NO TESTING - CRITICAL**

| Test Type | Coverage | Required |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Unit Tests (Backend) | 0% | ≥70% |
| Unit Tests (Frontend) | 0% | ≥70% |
| Integration Tests | 0% | ≥50% |
| E2E Tests | 0% | ≥30% |
| API Tests | 0% | ≥80% |
| Security Tests | 0% | 100% |

**Impact:** Cannot guarantee functionality or catch regressions

### 📊 **4. NO MONITORING/OBSERVABILITY**

❌ **Missing Components:**
- No application logging framework
- No error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar)
- No performance monitoring (APM)
- No uptime monitoring
- No database query monitoring
- No metrics/dashboards
- No alerting system

**Impact:** Cannot detect issues, measure performance, or debug production

### 🔧 **5. CONFIGURATION ISSUES**

#### **A. Environment Variables Not Validated**
```go
// No validation of required environment variables
JWT_SECRET=getEnv("JWT_SECRET", "your-super-secret-jwt-key")
```
**Fix Required:** Fail startup if critical env vars are missing/invalid

#### **B. GIN_MODE in Debug**
```env
GIN_MODE=debug  # ❌ Not production-ready
```
**Fix Required:** Set to `release` for production

#### **C. Missing Environment Files**
- ❌ No `.gitignore` file
- ❌ Secrets might be committed to git
**Fix Required:** Create .gitignore immediately

## ⚠️ MODERATE ISSUES (Should Fix)

### 🐳 **Docker & DevOps**

1. **Missing .dockerignore files**
   - Bloated image sizes
   - Potential secret leakage

2. **No health checks in docker-compose**
   ```yaml
   # Missing for all services
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
   ```

3. **No resource limits**
   - Services can consume unlimited resources
   - Missing `mem_limit`, `cpus`

4. **No restart policies for production**
   - `restart: always` may not be appropriate

5. **Missing production docker-compose**
   - Need separate `docker-compose.prod.yml`

### 📝 **Documentation**

1. **Missing API Documentation**
   - ❌ No Swagger/OpenAPI spec
   - ✅ Swagger comments present but not generated

2. **Missing Deployment Guide**
   - No production deployment instructions
   - No environment setup guide
   - No troubleshooting guide

3. **Missing Architecture Diagrams**
   - No system architecture diagram
   - No database schema diagram

### 💻 **Code Quality**

1. **No Linting Enforcement**
   - Backend: No golangci-lint config
   - Frontend: ESLint configured but may not be enforced

2. **No Pre-commit Hooks**
   - No husky or similar
   - Code quality not enforced before commit

3. **Missing Error Handling**
   - Some endpoints may not handle all error cases
   - Need comprehensive error middleware

### 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**

1. **Token Refresh Not Implemented**
   - JWT expires after 24h
   - No refresh token mechanism

2. **Password Reset Missing**
   - No forgot password flow
   - No email verification

3. **Session Management**
   - No logout mechanism
   - No session tracking

   - Day 1-2: Change all secrets and passwords
   - Day 3: Fix CORS, add HTTPS
   - Day 4: Update Docker images
   - Day 5: Add rate limiting and validation

2. **Week 2: Testing & Monitoring (HIGH)**
   - Day 1-3: Write critical tests (auth, bookings, payments)
   - Day 4: Add basic monitoring (logging, Sentry)
   - Day 5: Add health checks and backups

3. **Week 3: Documentation & DevOps (MEDIUM)**

   - Day 4: Load testing
   - Day 5: Final review and sign-off

### Minimum Viable Production (MVP)

If you need to deploy quickly, **absolute minimum requirements:**

1. ✅ Change all passwords and secrets
2. ✅ Fix CORS to specific domain
3. ✅ Add HTTPS/TLS
4. ✅ Set GIN_MODE=release
5. ✅ Add basic error logging
6. ✅ Configure database backups

## 📈 SCALABILITY ASSESSMENT

### Current Capacity
- **Concurrent Users:** ~100-200 (estimated)
- **Database Connections:** Limited by default MySQL settings
- **API Throughput:** ~1,000 req/min (estimated)

### Bottlenecks
1. **Database:** Single MySQL instance (no replication)
2. **Backend:** Single instance (no load balancing)
3. **No Caching:** Every request hits database

### Scaling Strategy
1. **Phase 1 (0-1k users):** Current architecture OK
2. **Phase 2 (1k-10k users):** Add Redis cache, DB read replicas
3. **Phase 3 (10k+ users):** Kubernetes, horizontal scaling, CDN

|-----------|------|------------|
| **Application Server** | t3.small (2 vCPU, 2GB) | $15-20 |
| **Database** | db.t3.micro (1 vCPU, 1GB) | $15-20 |
| **Load Balancer** | Application LB | $20-25 |
